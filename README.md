# Analyze Data And Build Dashboard From Airline Delay Performance Data Using A WebApp.
Create a comprehensive tool that enables efficient monitoring and analysis of delays across multiple airlines. The project involves collecting and processing data on flight delays, such as departure and arrival times, reasons for delays, and flight durations. Through advanced data analysis techniques, insights and patterns regarding delay trends can be derived. These findings will be visualized through an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard, accessible through a web app. The dashboard will provide key performance indicators, statistical summaries, and interactive visualizations to facilitate the understanding of delay patterns and assist in making informed decisions. The project aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of airline operations by providing actionable insights and a centralized platform for monitoring and managing delay performance.
